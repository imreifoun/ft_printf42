## Introduction

Welcome to ft_printf42! This project will take you on a journey into the world of variadic functions. In C programming, variadic functions provide a powerful way to handle a variable number of arguments. They add flexibility and versatility to your programs, allowing you to create functions that can adapt to different situations.

## Variadic Functions

Variadic functions are defined with a variable number of arguments. They consist of at least one fixed argument, followed by an ellipsis (`...`) as the last parameter. This allows you to pass any number of additional arguments to the function.

```c
int function_name(data_type variable_name, ...);
```

With variadic functions, you have the flexibility to handle different types and quantities of arguments based on your specific needs.

To work with variadic functions, you need to include the `<stdarg.h>` header file. This header provides functions and macros to access the variadic function arguments.

## Macros

The `<stdarg.h>` header provides several macros that are essential for working with variadic functions:

- `va_start`: Enables access to variadic function arguments.
- `va_arg`: Accesses the next variadic function argument.
- `va_copy`: Makes a copy of the variadic function arguments.
- `va_end`: Ends traversal of the variadic function arguments.

These macros allow you to iterate through the variable arguments and extract their values within the variadic function.

## Types

The `<stdarg.h>` header also introduces the `va_list` type. `va_list` is a data structure that holds the necessary information for the variadic functions. It is used by the macros mentioned above to manipulate the arguments.

## Project Resources
